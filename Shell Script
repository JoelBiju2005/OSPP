Code 1: Find the largest of two numbers

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter two numbers: "
read a b

if [ $a -gt $b ]
then
    echo "$a is the largest number."
elif [ $b -gt $a ]
then
    echo "$b is the largest number."
else
    echo "Both numbers are equal."
fi


Code 2: Check whether a number is even or odd
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number: "
read num

if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ]
then
    echo "The number is even."
else
    echo "The number is odd."
fi


✅ Explanation:

#!/bin/bash — Declares the script interpreter.
read — Takes user input.
if, elif, else, fi — Used for conditional branching.
$((expression)) — Used for arithmetic operations.
-gt → greater than, -eq → equal to.
